* Information about Trip Advisor

<p> 
  User can go through trips even not being logged in but before adding any item to basket or trips one has to login. Seperate portals for wishlisted trips, trips added to basket will be removed from trips. More details of a single trip or tour will be visible once user clicks. Search functionality has also been implemented. This was a small brief, hope you like it.
